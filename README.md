# normalDistribution

To anyone that was in the Discord chat, here is what we coded then.
Thanks all for the motivation, ideas and questions that made it possible!

Special shoot out to Chloe who asked for validation of my statement. This would never have happened otherwise!

It truly ended up being a random evening creating randomness out of random event!

Also Andy, I am expecting to see a blessed integration with a realtime graph update in the terminal!

## Instalation
In your terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/cloutierMat/normalDistribution.git
cd normalDistribution
npm start
```

## Features
It runs a million pass to create a nice random distibution.
If a million passes is too much for your potato computer to handle, modify the bellCurve.js at line 3 to a smaller number
```js
let maxCount = 100000
```

## Gaussian
For those who were there at the end when Danielle showed up and remembered us we were doing in over-complicated and over-wordly version of a gaussian function!
If you want to see the result with the more efficient but less random function type in terminal
```
node gaussian.js
```
